Player Wanted Status: Scenarios & Removal


I currenly have wanted status on a system level implemented. Now I want to add the wanted triggering mechanism.

Destorying any police vessel or Non-Hostile Ship (hauler) immediately flags you as wanted in that system

Police ships perform scans of any hauler within 500 units and send out a red circuar ping.

If the player is within that range and carrying contraband they will become wanted in that system
