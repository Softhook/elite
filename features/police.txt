Player Wanted Status: Scenarios & Removal
Based on analyzing the game code, here are realistic scenarios that can make your player character become wanted and methods to remove that status:

Scenarios That Trigger Wanted Status
Attacking Police Ships

Destorying any police vessel immediately flags you as wanted

Attacking Non-Hostile Ships

Firing on haulers, transports, or other non-pirate ships
Damaging station-owned vessels or station infrastructure
Carrying Illegal Cargo When Scanned

Being near police while carrying illegal goods (Narcotics, Weapons, Slaves)
Police ships perform scans within 500 units - fly too close with contraband and you'll be flagged
Failing Illegal Missions

Abandoning smuggling missions after accepting cargo
Getting caught during illegal delivery missions
Jettisoning Illegal Cargo Near Stations

Dumping contraband within station radar range
Removing Wanted Status
Pay Fines at Stations

Dock at stations in the "Repairs" screen
The fine scales with severity of crimes (50-500 credits)
Jump to Systems with Different Police

Your wanted status is primarily local to each system
Systems with "Anarchy" or "Low" security won't pursue you
Destroy All Witnesses

If you can destroy all police ships that have scanned you (before they radio ahead), your wanted status may be reduced
Wait it Out

Leave the area and return after several game days
Wanted status decays over time if no new crimes are committed
Complete Special Missions

Some stations offer "Clean Record" missions that clear your wanted status upon completion
These missions typically involve risky tasks to restore your reputation
