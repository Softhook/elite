Issue: When buying weapons, it currently just overwrites the first weapon slot
Ships have multiple weapon hardpoints defined in ship definition but can't use them
No UI for selecting which weapon slot to install into
No way to manage multiple weapons on complex ships

Problems:
Hits register when visually the projectile hasn't touched the ship
Misses occur when projectiles appear to hit elongated ship parts
No consideration for ship orientation during collision tests
Solution: Implement more precise hitbox system using ship vertex data
