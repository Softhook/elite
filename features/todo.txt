# Elite Game Development TODO

## Bugs and Issues


the guards availabe depend on econ of system


## Core Gameplay Enhancements



protective barrier

How can we increase the difficulty

refactoring

Integrate the nrrative class

use tech level for market and missions

- All projectile collisions use simple circle-based detection regardless of ship shape
Problems:
Hits register when visually the projectile hasn't touched the ship
Misses occur when projectiles appear to hit elongated ship parts
No consideration for ship orientation during collision tests
Solution: Implement more precise hitbox system using ship vertex data

police perform scan of any ship within 500 units lookig for illegal goods

jettson all inventory screen

planets have their own screen assocaited where it is possible to explre the planet. find things

mimitary bases on planets
mining sites on planets


Spcial events: 

- war seperatist vs alliance battle
- News famine change the cost of food in connected systems
- News religious uprising drop cost of luxury goods
- News war prerations cost of weapons goes up


some weapons better than lasers than hull
weapon range weapon speed

- Instea dof speratit call them alliance that are at war with imperial.
divide ships into imperial vs. alliance


- alien attack behaviour aim and shoot, asssasin
- opposturnity, assasin, alien enemy beahviour

- Implement ship upgrades beyond weapons:
- Shield generators/boosters
- limit the amount of goods aer availbe at certain planets based on their econmy
