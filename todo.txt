# Elite Game Development TODO

## Bugs and Issues



make recharge shields speed faster

i would all weapons to be able to damage asteroids. why is starsystem only checking for projectiles and not oter weapons?
asteroids not behaving right

- Fix weapon buying into slots on ship.currently just temp overwrites first weapon
Issue: When buying weapons, it currently just overwrites the first weapon slot
Ships have multiple weapon hardpoints defined in ship definition but can't use them
No UI for selecting which weapon slot to install into
No way to manage multiple weapons on complex ships
Solution: Implement proper weapon slot management with selection UI

- All projectile collisions use simple circle-based detection regardless of ship shape
Problems:
Hits register when visually the projectile hasn't touched the ship
Misses occur when projectiles appear to hit elongated ship parts
No consideration for ship orientation during collision tests
Solution: Implement more precise hitbox system using ship vertex data

- Fix AI behavior inconsistencies and edge cases
- Improve enemy targeting and combat decisions
- Fix potential memory leaks with explosion particles

- Alien ships should not be vailable to buy
